# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the "Contas a Receber do Sócio" (Member's Receivable Accounts) section in the credit transaction details page by adding edit and delete actions for individual receivable accounts. Currently, users can only view and select accounts for payment, but cannot modify or remove individual accounts. This enhancement will provide full CRUD operations for managing receivable accounts directly from the transaction details view.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a treasury administrator, I want to edit receivable account details directly from the transaction details page, so that I can quickly correct information without navigating to separate pages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the "Contas a Receber do Sócio" table THEN the system SHALL display an "Edit" button/icon for each receivable account row
2. WHEN clicking the "Edit" button THEN the system SHALL open a modal dialog with pre-populated form fields for the selected account
3. WHEN the edit modal is displayed THEN the system SHALL show fields for description, due date, value, and type
4. WHEN submitting valid changes in the edit modal THEN the system SHALL update the account and refresh the table display
5. WHEN submitting invalid data THEN the system SHALL display validation error messages without closing the modal

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a treasury administrator, I want to delete receivable accounts with confirmation, so that I can remove incorrect or duplicate entries safely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the "Contas a Receber do Sócio" table THEN the system SHALL display a "Delete" button/icon for each receivable account row
2. WHEN clicking the "Delete" button THEN the system SHALL show a confirmation dialog with account details
3. WHEN the confirmation dialog is displayed THEN the system SHALL show the account description, value, and due date for verification
4. WHEN confirming deletion THEN the system SHALL remove the account from the database and refresh the table display
5. WHEN canceling deletion THEN the system SHALL close the confirmation dialog without making changes
6. IF the account is associated with payments THEN the system SHALL prevent deletion and show an appropriate error message

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a treasury administrator, I want the edit and delete actions to be visually integrated with the existing table, so that the interface remains consistent and intuitive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the receivable accounts table THEN the system SHALL add an "Actions" column as the last column
2. WHEN displaying action buttons THEN the system SHALL use consistent styling with existing UI components
3. WHEN hovering over action buttons THEN the system SHALL show tooltips indicating the action (Edit/Delete)
4. WHEN performing actions THEN the system SHALL maintain the current page state and selections
5. WHEN actions complete successfully THEN the system SHALL show success notifications using the existing toast system

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a treasury administrator, I want proper error handling for edit and delete operations, so that I understand what went wrong when operations fail.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN edit or delete operations fail due to server errors THEN the system SHALL display specific error messages
2. WHEN network connectivity issues occur THEN the system SHALL show appropriate timeout or connection error messages
3. WHEN validation errors occur THEN the system SHALL highlight the problematic fields and show specific validation messages
4. WHEN concurrent modification conflicts occur THEN the system SHALL refresh the data and notify the user to retry
5. IF an account cannot be deleted due to business rules THEN the system SHALL explain why deletion is not allowed

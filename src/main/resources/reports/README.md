# JasperReports Fix Documentation

This directory contains documentation about the fixes made to resolve JasperReports issues in the application.

## Files Created

1. **JRXML_FIXES.md** - Initial analysis of issues and recommended fixes
2. **FIX_SUMMARY.md** - Summary of issues addressed and remaining issues
3. **FINAL_SUMMARY.md** - Final summary of all work completed
4. **CHANGES_MADE.md** - Detailed documentation of specific changes made
5. **VERIFICATION_REPORT.md** - Verification that the fixes were implemented correctly

## Changes Made

The following changes were made to resolve the WARN and ERROR messages in the application logs:

1. **Fixed deprecated isStretchWithOverflow attribute**:
   - In `subreport_rubrica.jrxml`, replaced `isStretchWithOverflow="true"` with `textAdjust="StretchHeight"`
   - This affects two `textField` elements in the "Detalhes dos Movimentos de Entrada" and "Detalhes dos Movimentos de Sa√≠da" sections

2. **Verified subDataset structure**:
   - Confirmed that the `subDataset` element in `subreport_rubrica.jrxml` is correctly placed at the end of the file
   - No changes were needed as the structure was already correct

## Files Needing Restoration

The following files appear to be incomplete or corrupted and need to be restored:
- `financeiro_grupos_rubrica_detalhado.jrxml`
- `grupo_rubrica_subreport.jrxml`

These files should be restored from a complete source to ensure proper report functionality.

## Testing

After restoring the incomplete files, the application should be tested to verify that:
1. The WARN messages about deprecated attributes no longer appear
2. The ERROR messages about invalid XML structure are resolved
3. The reports still function as expected

# JasperReports Fix Summary

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Fixed Deprecated isStretchWithOverflow Attribute
- **Files modified**: 
  - `subreport_rubrica.jrxml`
- **Changes made**:
  - Replaced `isStretchWithOverflow="true"` with `textAdjust="StretchHeight"` in two `textField` elements
  - This affects the "Detalhes dos Movimentos de Entrada" and "Detalhes dos Movimentos de Sa√≠da" sections

### 2. Verified subDataset Structure
- **Files checked**:
  - `subreport_rubrica.jrxml`
- **Findings**:
  - The `subDataset` element is correctly placed at the end of the file, which is the proper location according to the JasperReports schema
  - No structural issues were found with the placement of `subDataset` elements

## Remaining Issues

### Incomplete Main Report File
- The main report file `financeiro_grupos_rubrica_detalhado.jrxml` appears to be incomplete or corrupted
- Both the original file and backup contain only the header section
- This file needs to be restored from a complete source or recreated

## Recommendations

1. **Restore the main report file**:
   - Look for a complete version in version control (Git)
   - Check if there are any other backups of this file
   - If necessary, recreate the file based on the application's requirements

2. **Test the changes**:
   - After restoring the main report file, test the report generation to ensure the warnings and errors are resolved
   - Verify that the report still functions as expected with the updated attributes

3. **Consider updating JasperReports**:
   - If possible, consider updating to a newer version of JasperReports that may have better handling of these deprecated attributes
